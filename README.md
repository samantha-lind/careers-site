This careers site is a mocked-up page that allows job seekers to learn more about GoCo and browse current vacancies.

<h3>Challenge</h3>
I was asked to replicate a career page design provided as an image. All requisite images were supplied, however no other style details were listed.

<h3>Tools used</h3>
Per the instructions, I have limited this project to:
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Vanilla Javascript</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>
I've used Flex, rather than grid, to manage the page layout due to the relative simplicity of the layout. All styles have been replicated exactly except the font-family (Aktiv Grotesk is a paid font). I've instead used Roboto which is a close match.

No designs were provided for a mobile layout, so I've added a pop-up menu and changed all rows to columns.

<h3>Testing</h3>
This website has been tested on:

  <strong>Desktop: Windows & Mac</strong>
  <ul>
  <li>Edge 105, 104</li>
  <li>Firefox 104, 103</li>
  <li>Chrome 105, 104</li>
  <li>Opera 90, 89</li>
  <li>Safari 15.3</li>
 </ul>
 
 <strong>Mobile: iOS</strong>
 <ul>
  <li>Chrome and Safari 16, 15</li>
 </ul>
 
   <strong>Mobile: Android</strong>
  <ul>
  <li>Chrome and Firefox 13, 12, 11</li>
  <li>Samsung 12, 11</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Opportunities to iterate</h3>
In the future, this page could be improved by:
<ul>
  <li>Swapping images to webp to speed up the load time</li>
  <li>Removing JS and using CSS to manage the mobile menu</li>
